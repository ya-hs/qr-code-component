## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During this project, I learned a lot about how to manipulate elements in CSS to achieve the layout I desire. I had some issues with widths and how to choose between margins and padding for the effect I want.

Some snippets that show my issues with margins and padding:


```css
h1 {
    font-weight: 700;
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-size: 1.5em;
}

p {
    font-weight: 400;
    color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    padding: 0;
    width: 85%;
    margin: auto;
    margin-top: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
}

header {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 10px 20px 10px;
}
```
